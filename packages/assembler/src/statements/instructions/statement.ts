/**
 * An instruction.
 *
 * ```vonsim
 * label: MOV [bx], mem
 * ```
 *
 * Instructions are the most basic building blocks of a program.
 *
 * There are lots of different instructions, but they share some common properties.
 * So, they have been grouped in classes that extend this one:
 * - {@link ZeroaryInstruction}
 * - {@link BinaryInstruction}
 * - {@link UnaryInstruction}
 * - {@link StackInstruction}
 * - {@link JumpInstruction}
 * - {@link IOInstruction}
 * - {@link IntInstruction}
 *
 * Some of them can accept operands. These operands can point to labels.
 * Because of this, we need to wait until all labels addresses and constants have been
 * computed by the {@link GlobalStore} to get the actual operand values.
 *
 * Before that, we can only get generic {@link NumberExpression}s.
 *
 * Nonetheless, we can still compute the length of the instruction with only
 * the types of the labels. This is important because instructions can vary in length
 * depending on the types of the labels.
 *
 * For instance,
 *
 * ```vonsim
 * mov al, label
 * ```
 *
 * If `label` is a constant, the instruction is a MOV reg<-imd (3 bytes).
 * However, if `label` points to a DB, the instruction is a MOV reg<-mem (direct) (4 bytes).
 *
 * With that in mind, the flow of "assembling" an instruction is:
 * - Create the instruction with operands.
 * - Validate the instruction with `InstructionStatement#validate`, getting generic {@link NumberExpression}s.
 * - {@link GlobalStore} uses `InstructionStatement#length` to compute the address of the instruction.
 * - With these addresses, {@link GlobalStore} can compute the addresses of the labels.
 * - We use `InstructionStatement#evaluateExpressions` to get the actual operand values.
 *
 * ---
 * This class is: MUTABLE
